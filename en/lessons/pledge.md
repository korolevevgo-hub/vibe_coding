# 😎 Vibe Coder's Oath

## 🌊 I solemnly swear:

### 1. **Not to Fear Experiments**
I will try new models, tools and approaches, because vibe coding is about exploration, not fear of the unknown.

### 2. **Keep My Code Private**
I will use local LLMs so my code doesn't leak to the cloud. My privacy is my responsibility.

### 3. **Share Knowledge**
If I find a cool model or configuration, I will share it with the community. Vibe coding becomes stronger when we help each other.

### 4. **Not Forget the Basics**
LLM is a tool, not a brain replacement. I will understand the code the model generates and won't blindly copy everything.

### 5. **Have Fun**
Programming should be enjoyable. If a model helps me code faster and with less stress — that's good.
